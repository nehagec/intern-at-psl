<h1><a name="branch"></a>branching and merging</h1>
<p>
 The Git feature that really makes it stand apart
 from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.</p>
<p>
Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local 
branches that can be entirely independent of each other.
 The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds. </p>

<h2><a name="small"></a>small and fast</h2>
<p> Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally,
 giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly 
 have to communicate with a server somewhere.</p>
<p>
Git was built to work on the Linux kernel, 
meaning that it has had to effectively handle large 
repositories from day one. Git is written in C, reducing the 
overhead of runtimes associated with higher-level languages.
 Speed and performance has been a primary design goal of the Git from the start.

 <h3><a name="distributed"> </a>distributed</h3>

<p>
One of the nicest features of any <strong>Distributed SCM</strong>,
 Git included, is that it's distributed.
 This means that instead of doing a "checkout" of the current
 tip of the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire repository.
Multiple Backups</p>
<p>
This means that even if you're using a centralized workflow, 
every user essentially has a full backup of the main server.
 Each of these copies could be pushed up to replace the main server in
 the event of a crash or corruption. In effect, there is no single point
 of failure with Git unless there is only a single copy of the repository.

 <h4><a name="stage"> </a>staging area<h4>
 <p>
 This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your
 learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files 
 can reside in: committed, modified, and staged.</p>
<p> Committed means that the 
 data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have
 changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
 Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to
 go into your next commit snapshot.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:
 the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area. </p>
